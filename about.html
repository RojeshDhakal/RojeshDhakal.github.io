        <p>
            Hello! My name is Rojesh Dhakal, and I am a passionate and driven individual currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in <strong>FinTech and Investment Management</strong> at Lincoln University. With a strong foundation in finance and technology, I am keen on leveraging innovative solutions to drive growth and efficiency in the financial sector.

            In addition to my master's program, I have completed several certifications and courses that have enhanced my skills and knowledge in various fields. I hold a <strong>Certification in Data Science & AI</strong> from Auckland University of Technology (AUT), where I gained hands-on experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, and AI algorithms.

            My journey also includes a comprehensive course in <strong>Business Intelligence</strong> from Future Skills. This program equipped me with the tools and techniques to analyze complex data sets, create interactive dashboards, and generate insightful reports. I have developed a keen eye for data visualization and a strong understanding of data governance and quality.

        <p>
            Moreover, I have a solid background in cloud computing, from <strong>Cloud Engineering</strong> course at Yoobee College. Here, I learned to design, deploy, and manage cloud-based solutions, with a particular focus on cloud security and automation. Proficiency in major cloud platforms such as AWS and Microsoft Azure has been a key outcome of this education.
