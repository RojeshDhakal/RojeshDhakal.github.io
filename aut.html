        <h2>AUT Data Science & AI Certification</h2>
        <p>
            I have completed a <strong>Certification in Data Science & AI</strong> from Auckland University of Technology (AUT), which provided me with a comprehensive understanding of advanced data science and artificial intelligence concepts. This certification has been instrumental in honing my technical skills and preparing me for the data-driven world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program covered a broad range of topics including machine learning, statistical analysis, data mining, and AI algorithms. I gained hands-on experience with programming languages such as Python and R, and used libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn to develop and implement machine learning models.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
            A key aspect of my education at AUT was working on practical projects that involved real-world data. These projects required me to clean, analyze, and visualize data, build predictive models, and interpret the results to provide actionable insights.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the course emphasized the ethical considerations and implications of AI. I learned about the importance of transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI applications, which is crucial for developing responsible and trustworthy AI systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The certification from AUT has significantly enhanced my problem-solving and analytical capabilities. It has equipped me with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex data challenges and contribute effectively to any data science and AI initiatives.
